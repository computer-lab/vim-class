Lesson 2.4: Using a count for a motion

Try to move from the point marked 'a' to the point marked 'b' using
one command (e.g. 3e or 2w).

       a           b
e stands for the end of the word.

                        a      b
w means word, that is, move to the next word.

                        a          b        c           d
punctation counts as a word, so this comma, and this one, count.

c                    a             b
use 0 to jump to the first character of the line.

Delete the lines that don't belong below using dd. It's up to you to
pick which ones don't belong!
Hint: Precede the command with a count to delete multiple lines,
e.g. 2dd - delete two lines.

I said a hip hop, hippie to the hippie
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie
A host, of golden daffodils;
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Tell me,
Muse, how it all began. Why was Juno outraged?
What could wound the Queen of the Gods with all her power?
